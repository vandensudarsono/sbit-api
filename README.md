# sbit-api
this is for the rest api that will call request to sbit-emitter service using gRPC. 
However this project is not ready yet because we don't implement gRPC client yet. 

- Please copy `config/.env.yaml.example` first to the root project and rename it to `.env.yaml` . Fill the field with your own environment parameters.    

- Running this service using command 
```bash
    go run main.go serve
```
